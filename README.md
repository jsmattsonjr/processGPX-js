# processGPX-js

A JavaScript port of processGPX, designed to improve and create GPX files for cycling emulation platforms like BikeTerra. This client-side application brings the powerful GPX processing capabilities of the original Perl tool to the browser.

## About

processGPX is a series of algorithms to improve and create GPX files, particularly for cycling emulation platforms. The original tool was written for RGT and is now being ported to JavaScript for use as a client-side web application.

### Key Features

- **GPX Processing**: Improves low-resolution GPX files from online mapping tools
- **Route Smoothing**: Smooths altitude data and position coordinates to eliminate anomalies
- **Corner Rounding**: Ensures corners are sufficiently round for realistic cycling simulation
- **Gradient Correction**: Fixes anomalously large gradient changes between points
- **Point Interpolation**: Adds points where needed for better route definition
- **Out-and-Back Routes**: Creates turn-around loops and lane-shifted return paths
- **Quality Analysis**: Calculates quality scores based on gradient and direction changes

### Original processGPX

The original processGPX (v0.52) was written in Perl by Daniel Connelly. It addresses common issues with GPX files exported from tools like Strava Route Editor:

- Too low resolution in position data
- Small errors in altitude measurements
- Sharp corners that need rounding
- Gradient anomalies between points

## Testing

This project uses Jest for testing with a comprehensive fuzzing approach to ensure robust coverage of the GPX processing pipeline.

### Test Setup

The testing framework combines:
- **CLI Option Fuzzer**: Generates random combinations of CLI options for comprehensive testing
- **Jest Integration**: Collects code coverage while testing both `process-cli.js` and `js/process-gpx.js`
- **Direct Function Testing**: Tests the core processing functions with realistic option combinations

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run basic tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage reporting
npm run test:coverage

# Run standalone fuzzer (without Jest)
npm run test:fuzz 50  # Run 50 random test combinations
```

### Fuzzing Architecture

The fuzzer (`fuzz-cli.js`) provides comprehensive testing by:
1. **Generating Random Options**: Creates realistic combinations of CLI options
2. **Testing Multiple GPX Files**: Uses 70+ real-world GPX files from the `gpx/` directory
3. **Validating Constraints**: Respects option dependencies and mutual exclusions
4. **Collecting Coverage**: Jest tracks code paths exercised during fuzzing

```bash
# Generate sample fuzz commands
node fuzz-cli.js --generate

# Generate option arrays for Jest
node fuzz-cli.js --generate-options
```

### Test Coverage

The Jest setup captures coverage from:
- **CLI Processing** (`process-cli.js`): Argument parsing, file I/O, error handling
- **Core Algorithms** (`js/process-gpx.js`): GPX processing pipeline, smoothing, interpolation
- **Edge Cases**: Random option combinations reveal corner cases and error conditions

Example coverage output:
```
--------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
File                      | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
--------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
process-cli.js           |   85.2  |   73.1   |  100.0  |   84.8  |
js/process-gpx.js        |   78.9  |   65.4   |   91.3  |   78.2  |
--------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
```

## Debugging

The `dumpPoints()` function in `js/process-gpx.js` is used to dump the state of the points array at various stages of processing. These dumps are saved as tab-separated text files in the `debug/` directory.

A utility script, `debug_to_gpx.js`, is provided to convert these debug files back into GPX format for visualization and analysis.

### Converting Debug Dumps to GPX

To convert a debug file to a GPX file, run the following command:

```bash
npm run debug:to-gpx -- debug/your_debug_file.txt
```

This will create a new file, `your_debug_file.gpx`, in the same directory.

## Usage (Planned)

The JavaScript port will provide both programmatic API access and a web interface:

### Web Interface
```html
<!-- Load processGPX in the browser -->
<script src="processGPX.js"></script>
<script>
  const processor = new ProcessGPX();
  processor.loadFile(gpxFile)
    .process({ auto: true })
    .then(result => {
      // Download processed GPX
      result.download();
    });
</script>
```

### Node.js API
```javascript
import { ProcessGPX } from 'processGPX-js';

const processor = new ProcessGPX();
const result = await processor
  .loadFile('input.gpx')
  .process({
    auto: true,
    smooth: 10,
    smoothZ: 20,
    spacing: 5
  });

await result.save('output.gpx');
```

## Key Processing Options (Planned)

Based on the original processGPX functionality:

- `auto`: Automatic processing with reasonable defaults
- `smooth`: Position smoothing distance in meters
- `smoothZ`: Altitude smoothing distance in meters
- `spacing`: Point interpolation spacing in meters
- `loop`: Treat as loop/circuit course
- `outAndBack`: Create out-and-back course with turn-around
- `laneShift`: Shift lanes for out-and-back separation
- `minRadius`: Minimum corner radius enforcement
- `prune`: Remove unnecessary points

## Development Status
